# Kotori Bot (TypeScript)
### This is an upgraded and TypeScript version of my basic Python Discord ChatBot.

If you want to use this for your own chatbot make sure to create a .env file in the project's directory with the following variables:
+ TOKEN (Your Discord Application Token)
+ CLIENT_ID (Your Discord Application ID)
+ GEMINI_API_KEY (Your Google Gemini API Key)

You can use the existing character (Kotori) from characters.json or add your own characters.

Run these commands to start running
```
npx tsx src/deploy_commands.ts
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

### Have fun! ðŸ‘‹
