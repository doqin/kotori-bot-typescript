# Kotori Bot (TypeScript)
### This is an upgraded and TypeScript version of my basic Python Discord ChatBot.

If you want to use this for your own chatbot make sure to create a .env file in the project's directory with the following variables:
+ TOKEN (Your Discord Application Token)
+ CLIENT_ID (Your Discord Application ID)
+ GEMINI_API_KEY (Your Google Gemini API Key)

Run these commands to start running
```
npm install
npx tsx src/deploy_commands.ts
npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> Open the `configurations.json` file and adjust the variables to your preferences.
> 
> You can use the existing character (Kotori) from `characters.json` or add your own characters.

If you want an interface for checking chatlogs from the database consider using my personal chatlogger made just for this.
